“Autism is a lifelong development disability which affects how people communicate and interact with the world.  It is estimated that at least 1 in 100 people in India are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is over 12 million individuals in India.  There is no conclusive evidence of what causes autism, but a few possible causes have been put forward by researchers in this field. Given the complexity of the condition, and since symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. Genetics and other environmental factors may play a role. Vaccines don’t play a role in causing autism.  ARC is a registered charitable trust (No.8/BK4/2019) incorporated in January 2019 for the benefit of people and families with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  Since October 2020, we are running a residential group home in Vellore, providing support to 6 adults with Autism on a full-time basis.  Therapies that are effective in the treatment of Autism are early intervention, applied behaviour analysis (ABA), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), social skills training, occupational therapy (OT), speech and language therapy (SaLT), sensory integration therapy, educational and school based therapies,  and use of assistive technologies”
